            .about__content I'm a Computer Engineering student at the University of Waterloo. I love web technologies and I love connecting people together. I'm a developer at heart, and I'm always trying to find the best way to solve problems. I'm a hard working, go-getter who likes getting things done, and doing things well. I work best in teams with strong collaboration and I love taking initiative for new ideas. <br/>Interested in working together? I'd love to hear from you!
